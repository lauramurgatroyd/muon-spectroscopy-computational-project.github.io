<strong><em>The Journal of Chemical Physics, 148, 134114, (2018)</em></strong><br />
The stopping site of the muon in a muon-spin relaxation experiment (mu+SR) is generally unknown and there few techniques that can be used to determine the muon stopping site. In this work, we propose a purely theoretical method that can be used to predict muon stopping sites in crystalline materials using only computer simulations.</p>

    <p><a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5085197">Comparison between Density Functional Theory and Density Functional Tight Binding approaches for finding the muon stopping site in organic molecular crystals</a><br />
<strong><em>The Journal of Chemical Physics, 150, 154301, (2019)</em></strong>
Expanding on our previous use of AIRSS to find the muon stopping site, this paper focuses on its application to organic molecules and shows how the tight binding software DFTB+, combined with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">3ob-3-1</code> parameter set, can produce satisfying results for it in a fraction of the time required by DFT simulations.</p>

<strong><em>J. Phys. Chem. C, 124, 18, 9656–9664, (2020)</em></strong>
Phenylacetylene-capped silicon nanoparticles have attracted interest as a novel thermoelectric material. In this paper, we report a combined muon spectroscopic (μSR) and computational study of this material in solution to investigate the microscopic electronic structure of this system.</p>

<strong><em>The Journal of Chemical Physics, 153, 044111 (2020)</em></strong>
In this work, we present a software implementation of the Unperturbed Electrostatic Potential (UEP) Method: an approach used for finding the muon stopping site in crystalline materials. The UEP method requires only one DFT calculation, necessary to compute the electronic density of the host material.</p>

<strong><em>X-Ray Spectrometry,1–17, (2020)</em></strong>
In this work, we present mudirac: a new open‐source software for the integration of the radial Dirac equation developed specifically for muonic atoms. The software can be used to predict frequencies and transitions probabilities between levels of the muonic atom, which are useful for the interpretation of muonic X‐ray spectra in elemental analysis.</p>

    <p><a href="https://leandro-liborio.github.io/files/MuSR2017.pdf">Computational Prediction of Muon Stopping Sites in Silicon</a><br />
<strong><em>The 14th International Conference on Muon Spin Rotation, Relaxation and Resonance. 30 June 2017, Sapporo, Japan.</em></strong><br />
This work focuses on the paramagnetic states formed by muons in semiconductors. In particular, it revisits the case of muons in pure Si, and uses a combination of computational methods to estimate the muon stopping sites.</p>

    <p><a href="https://leandro-liborio.github.io/files/MuonStoppingSite2018.pdf">Computer Simulations for Interpreting µSR Experiments: Beyond DFT</a>  <br />
<strong><em>Muon Spectroscopy User Meeting: Future Developments and Site Calculations.
 17 July 2018, The Cosener’s House, Abingdon, UK.</em></strong><br />
This presentation discusses the computational methods that we had developed so far to estimate the muon stopping site in crystalline materials. The key new concept is the development of methods based on calculations other than ab-initio calculations. The idea is that the new calculations are computationally faster than the purely ab initio ones. One of the methods that I have tested is the DFT-based Tight-Binding.</p>

<strong><em>The 2018 ISIS Muon Spectroscopy Training School.  22 March 2018, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell, UK.</em></strong><br />
This talk presents the key concepts and the main approximations used in our computer models, and also discusses why some of these approximations are relevant to muon experiments. In particular, there is a brief introduction to Density Functional Theory (DFT) and how it can be used to study muonated molecular and crystalline systems. This talk also presents the basis for the method that we are developing to predict the muon stopping sites in crystalline materials.</p>

<strong><em>International Advanced School on Muon Spectroscopy.  15-22 August 2019, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell, UK.</em></strong><br />
This talk presents the key concepts and the main approximations used in our computer models. The talk discusses Density Functional Theory (DFT), briefly presents some of the current codes that implement DFT and how these different codes can be used to study muonated crystalline systems. In particular, the talk presents all the methods that we developed to predict the muon stopping site in crystalline systems.</p>

<strong><em>2020 Edition Muon Site Calculation Meeting (Virtual Edition) Friday 4th September, 2020.</em></strong><br />
In this talk, we presented the work that we are doing -and plan to do- as part of a grant that we obtained from Ada Lovelace Centre for the development of muon software. The main objective of this grant is the development of a sustainable and user-friendly software platform that can be used for developing software for interpreting muon experiments.</p>
