### Software 

The Muon Spectroscopy Computational Project (MSCP) uses a wide range of software 
packages that allow us to develop our tools. Below, there is a list of 
some of the software packages currently in use by the MSCP:

* **[The Atomistic Simulation Environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)**:
The Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) is a set of tools and Python modules 
for setting up, manipulating, running, visualizing and analyzing atomistic simulations
performed with many of the most popular simulation codes currently available. 

* **[Soprano](https://ccp-nc.github.io/soprano/)**:
Soprano is a Python library developed and maintained by the **[Collaborative Computational 
Project for NMR Crystallography](https://www.ccpnc.ac.uk/)**. Soprano is a software tool designed
to help scientists, who are working with crystallography and simulations, to generate, 
manipulate, run and analyse computer simulations on large data sets of crystalline structures. 
It provides a number of functionalities to help automate many common tasks in 
computational crystallography.
