## The Ab Initio Random Structure Search (AIRSS) method

The method is based on a combination of ab initio calculations, random structure searching, 
and machine learning methodologies and can -in principle- be used to predict the 
stopping site of the **paramagnetic** and **diamagnetic** muon in any type of periodic 
crystalline structure.
